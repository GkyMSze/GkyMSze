### Hi there, my name is Tristan Sze ðŸ‘‹

Currently I am wrapping up Harvard's introductory programming class cs50! It was a goal of mine to complete this course this summer and I am excited to say I am nearly there! This fall I will begin my first semester as a student at Purdue University where I will be learning programming fundamentals in Java. I cannot wait to share my future projects here!
