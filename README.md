### Hi there, my name is Tristan Sze ðŸ‘‹

I am just beginning my freshman year at Purdue University where I am pursuing a bachelor's in computer science and mathematics as well as a minor in economics. Recently, I completed Harvard's CS50 introductory computer science course where I completed a project that concluded with my creation of a Pokemon guessing game inspired by The New York Times' hit-game Wordle. This fall I will be learning more about Java and OOP in Purdue's CS180 course.
